# Java Game Collection

Working collection of games created using Java<br>
NOT a final product


Current Bugs:
  -Memory Game Stats button not in use
    Stats class in Memory Game is being transitioned to Log4j for use of entire game collection
  -Adjusting speed and values of enemy location in Space Invasion game
    this may cause some enemies to not dying when shot until I finish fixing that
  -Working on fixing bug with bullets hitting muliple player ships at a time
    bug may cause player to loose multiple ships at a time when player is shot between two ships
